### Description
QTify is an engaging music browsing web application, and I crafted the UI from scratch based on Figma design. Crafting a captivating Navbar and Hero Section, I seamlessly integrated features like displaying top albums, implementing a collapsible card grid to carousel transition, and introducing a genre-based song filter. Subsequent modules involved designing a compelling Hero Section, displaying top albums, implementing a dynamic card grid with a collapsible carousel, and enhancing user experience by enabling genre-based song filtering.
